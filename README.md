<center><h4>A UDP (User Datagram Protocol) DOS (Denial-of-Service) attack is a type of cyber attack that targets network infrastructure or servers by overwhelming them with a flood of UDP packets.
<br>
UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that it doesn't establish a connection before sending data, and as a result, it's easier to spoof the sender's IP address. This makes UDP a popular protocol for attackers to use in DOS attacks.
<br>
In a UDP DOS attack, the attacker floods the victim's network or server with a high volume of UDP packets, which consume the server's resources and bandwidth. As a result, the victim's network or server becomes unresponsive and denies service to legitimate users.
<br>
Unlike a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) DOS attack, where the attacker establishes a connection with the victim's server before launching the attack, a UDP DOS attack doesn't require a connection. This makes it easier to launch the attack from multiple sources, which makes it harder to block the attack traffic.</h4></center>
